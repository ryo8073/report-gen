# Critical Production Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical production issues that are preventing the application from functioning properly and delivering quality reports as intended.

## Glossary

- **JavaScript Module System**: The ES6 import/export system used for organizing code
- **CCR Analysis**: Cash-on-Cash Return analysis as specified in investment prompts
- **Leverage Analysis**: Analysis of positive/negative leverage effects in investment reports
- **Rich Text Editor**: The WYSIWYG editor component for report editing
- **Preview Layout**: The user interface layout for previewing report content
- **Template System**: The system for applying document templates and formatting
- **Syntax Error**: JavaScript parsing errors that prevent code execution

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: JavaScript Module System Fixes

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without JavaScript errors, so that all features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads, THE System SHALL resolve all JavaScript syntax errors in module files
2. WHEN ES6 modules are used, THE System SHALL ensure proper export/import syntax compatibility
3. WHEN browser compatibility is required, THE System SHALL use appropriate module loading patterns
4. WHEN template system initializes, THE System SHALL ensure all dependencies are properly loaded
5. THE System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Requirement 2: Report Content Quality Enhancement

**User Story:** As an investment analyst, I want reports to include proper CCR and leverage analysis as specified in prompts, so that I receive accurate investment analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating investment reports, THE System SHALL include FCR (総収益率) analysis from prompt specifications
2. WHEN calculating leverage effects, THE System SHALL determine positive/negative leverage based on FCR vs K% comparison
3. WHEN analyzing CCR (自己資金配当率), THE System SHALL provide accurate cash-on-cash return calculations
4. WHEN presenting investment data, THE System SHALL include yield gap analysis (FCR - K%)
5. THE System SHALL ensure reports follow the 4-part structure (Executive Summary, Benefits, Risks, Evidence) as specified in prompts

### Requirement 3: Rich Text Editor Layout Improvement

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want the preview area to be easily accessible and not interfere with the editing area, so that I can efficiently edit and preview content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the rich text editor, THE System SHALL position preview area in an accessible location
2. WHEN switching between edit and preview modes, THE System SHALL maintain clear visual separation
3. WHEN viewing preview content, THE System SHALL ensure it doesn't obscure the editing area
4. WHEN working with long content, THE System SHALL provide proper scrolling and navigation
5. THE System SHALL maintain responsive design across different screen sizes
