# Site Critical Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

The deployed site has critical issues preventing proper functionality, including JavaScript errors, authentication conflicts, and most importantly, reports not reflecting the latest prompts. This spec addresses these core problems to restore full site functionality.

## Glossary

- **Report_System**: The AI-powered report generation system that processes user input and generates business reports
- **Prompt_Engine**: The component that loads and applies prompt templates for report generation
- **Rich_Text_Editor**: The enhanced editor interface for viewing and editing generated reports
- **Authentication_System**: User authentication and session management components
- **JavaScript_Runtime**: The browser JavaScript execution environment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Prompt System Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want generated reports to reflect the latest prompt templates, so that I get accurate and up-to-date analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a report type, THE Report_System SHALL load the corresponding latest prompt template
2. WHEN the Report_System processes user input, THE Prompt_Engine SHALL apply the current prompt template without errors
3. WHEN a report is generated, THE Report_System SHALL display content that matches the selected prompt template structure
4. WHEN prompt templates are updated, THE Report_System SHALL use the new templates immediately without cache issues
5. THE Report_System SHALL validate that prompt templates are properly loaded before report generation

### Requirement 2: JavaScript Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the site to load without JavaScript errors, so that all features work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site loads, THE JavaScript_Runtime SHALL execute all scripts without syntax errors
2. WHEN JavaScript files are loaded, THE JavaScript_Runtime SHALL find all required functions and classes
3. IF a JavaScript dependency is missing, THEN THE JavaScript_Runtime SHALL provide graceful fallbacks
4. WHEN the Rich_Text_Editor initializes, THE JavaScript_Runtime SHALL complete initialization without errors
5. THE JavaScript_Runtime SHALL suppress all authentication-related errors in trial mode

### Requirement 3: Authentication System Cleanup

**User Story:** As a trial user, I want to use the site without authentication errors, so that I can focus on generating reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site loads in trial mode, THE Authentication_System SHALL not attempt database connections
2. WHEN Supabase or Firebase scripts are present, THE Authentication_System SHALL disable them completely
3. WHEN authentication tokens are requested, THE Authentication_System SHALL return null without errors
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL prevent all 400/401/403 HTTP errors related to authentication
5. WHEN users interact with the site, THE Authentication_System SHALL not interfere with core functionality

### Requirement 4: Simplified Report Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily read and interact with generated reports, so that I can quickly understand the analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a report is generated, THE Rich_Text_Editor SHALL display content in a clear, readable format
2. WHEN the report is long, THE Rich_Text_Editor SHALL provide easy navigation and scrolling
3. WHEN users want to copy content, THE Rich_Text_Editor SHALL provide simple copy functionality
4. WHEN users want to export reports, THE Rich_Text_Editor SHALL offer PDF and Word export options
5. IF the enhanced editor fails, THEN THE Rich_Text_Editor SHALL fall back to a simple, functional display

### Requirement 5: Core Functionality Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want all essential features to work consistently, so that I can rely on the site for report generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users submit report requests, THE Report_System SHALL process them successfully
2. WHEN file uploads are included, THE Report_System SHALL handle them without errors
3. WHEN different report types are selected, THE Report_System SHALL apply the correct templates
4. WHEN reports are generated, THE Report_System SHALL display results within 60 seconds
5. THE Report_System SHALL maintain functionality even if non-essential features fail
