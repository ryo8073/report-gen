# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The investment analysis application currently relies solely on OpenAI's ChatGPT API for generating investment reports. To improve system reliability and reduce service disruptions, the system needs to integrate Google AI Studio/Gemini API as a backup service that can seamlessly take over when ChatGPT is unavailable, rate-limited, or experiencing issues.

## Glossary

- **Primary_AI_Service**: OpenAI ChatGPT API - the main AI service for report generation
- **Backup_AI_Service**: Google AI Studio/Gemini API (specifically Gemini Pro model) - the fallback AI service
- **AI_Service_Manager**: Component that manages failover between AI services
- **Service_Health_Monitor**: Component that tracks AI service availability and performance
- **Failover_Logic**: The decision-making process for switching between AI services
- **Report_Generator**: The existing component that interfaces with AI services
- **Investment_Analysis_System**: The main application system
- **API_Response_Normalizer**: Component that standardizes responses from different AI services

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically use a backup AI service when the primary service is unavailable, so that I can still generate investment reports without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Primary_AI_Service is unavailable, THE AI_Service_Manager SHALL automatically switch to Backup_AI_Service
2. WHEN Backup_AI_Service successfully generates a report, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL deliver the report to the user without indicating service switching
3. THE AI_Service_Manager SHALL attempt to use Primary_AI_Service first for all requests
4. WHEN both services are unavailable, THEN THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL provide graceful degradation with a basic analysis template

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure both ChatGPT and Gemini API credentials securely, so that the system can authenticate with both services when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL store both OpenAI API key and Google AI Studio API key securely in environment variables
2. THE AI_Service_Manager SHALL validate both API keys during system initialization
3. WHEN either API key is invalid or missing, THEN THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL log the error and continue with the available service
4. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL support independent configuration of each AI service

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to normalize responses from different AI services, so that the frontend receives consistent report formats regardless of which AI service generated the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Response_Normalizer SHALL convert responses from both AI services into a standardized format
2. WHEN either AI service returns a response, THE API_Response_Normalizer SHALL ensure consistent section headers and structure
3. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL maintain the same report quality standards across both AI services
4. THE Report_Generator SHALL use equivalent prompts for both AI services to ensure consistent analysis depth

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and performance of both AI services, so that I can track reliability and make informed decisions about service usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Service_Health_Monitor SHALL track response times, success rates, and error patterns for both AI services
2. WHEN an AI service fails repeatedly, THE Service_Health_Monitor SHALL temporarily mark it as unhealthy
3. THE AI_Service_Manager SHALL prefer healthy services over unhealthy ones when making routing decisions
4. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL log service switching events with timestamps and reasons

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the backup AI service to handle the same types of investment analysis requests as the primary service, so that I receive equivalent quality reports regardless of which service is used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backup_AI_Service SHALL support all report types (basic, intermediate, advanced) that Primary_AI_Service supports
2. WHEN generating reports with Backup_AI_Service, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL use prompts equivalent to Primary_AI_Service prompts
3. THE AI_Service_Manager SHALL pass the same investment data and preferences to both services
4. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL maintain consistent token usage tracking across both services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent failover logic that considers various failure scenarios, so that the system makes optimal decisions about when to switch between AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Primary_AI_Service returns rate limit errors, THE Failover_Logic SHALL immediately try Backup_AI_Service
2. WHEN Primary_AI_Service has network timeouts, THE Failover_Logic SHALL retry once before switching to Backup_AI_Service
3. WHEN Primary_AI_Service returns authentication errors, THE Failover_Logic SHALL mark it as unhealthy and use Backup_AI_Service
4. THE AI_Service_Manager SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
