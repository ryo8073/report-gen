# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current 1-page report generation system has multiple critical issues preventing it from working properly. The system requires login authentication but fails due to authentication flow problems, API endpoint mismatches, missing environment variables, and database initialization issues. This spec addresses fixing these urgent issues to make the system functional within a day.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the report generation page after successful login, so that I can generate reports without encountering authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the main page without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the main report generation page
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the main page THEN the system SHALL display their user information and allow report generation
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to work consistently, so that I can log in and stay logged in during my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using the correct API endpoint
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL set proper session cookies
3. WHEN a user's session is valid THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state across page refreshes
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to login page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the report generation functionality to work properly, so that I can create reports from my input text and files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user submits a report generation request THEN the system SHALL process it using the correct API endpoint
2. WHEN the report generation is successful THEN the system SHALL display the generated content
3. WHEN report generation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user uploads files THEN the system SHALL validate and process them correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Firebase setup and database system to be properly configured and initialized, so that users can register and log in successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN Firebase SHALL be properly configured with all required environment variables
2. WHEN Firebase configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the database SHALL be properly initialized with required collections
4. WHEN the system starts THEN an admin user SHALL be created if one doesn't exist
5. WHEN Firebase service account credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
6. WHEN Firestore rules are not configured THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on setting them up

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN the system encounters configuration issues THEN it SHALL display helpful debugging information
### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear Firebase setup documentation and configuration validation, so that I can quickly resolve Firebase-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL list exactly which variables need to be set
2. WHEN Firebase service account setup is incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step setup instructions
3. WHEN Firestore security rules are not configured THEN the system SHALL provide the required rules
4. WHEN Firebase project configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL validate and report specific issues
5. WHEN the system detects Firebase setup problems THEN it SHALL provide a comprehensive troubleshooting guide
