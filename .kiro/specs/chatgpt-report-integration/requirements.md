# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The investment analysis application needs to integrate with ChatGPT API to generate comprehensive investment reports and summaries. This feature will leverage OpenAI's ChatGPT API to analyze user-provided investment data and generate professional reports while maintaining the existing user management database system.

## Glossary

- **ChatGPT_API**: OpenAI's ChatGPT API service for generating text-based responses
- **Investment_Analysis_System**: The main application that processes user investment data
- **Report_Generator**: The component responsible for interfacing with ChatGPT API
- **User_Management_Database**: The existing Firebase/Firestore database for user authentication and data
- **Investment_Report**: The generated document containing analysis and recommendations
- **API_Token**: OpenAI API key for authenticating requests to ChatGPT

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to input my investment data and receive a comprehensive analysis report generated by ChatGPT, so that I can make informed investment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user submits investment data, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL send the data to ChatGPT_API for analysis
2. WHEN ChatGPT_API returns analysis results, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL format and display the report to the user
3. WHEN the report generation is successful, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL save the report to the User_Management_Database
4. IF ChatGPT_API is unavailable, THEN THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ChatGPT API integration to be securely configured with proper API key management, so that the system can reliably access OpenAI services without exposing credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL store the API_Token securely in environment variables
2. WHEN making requests to ChatGPT_API, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL include proper authentication headers
3. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL validate API_Token before making requests
4. IF API_Token is invalid or missing, THEN THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL log the error and provide setup instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my previously generated investment reports, so that I can track my investment analysis history over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their report history, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL retrieve reports from the User_Management_Database
2. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL display reports in chronological order with creation dates
3. WHEN a user selects a specific report, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL display the full report content
4. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL associate each report with the correct user account

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ChatGPT integration to handle API rate limits and errors gracefully, so that users have a reliable experience even during high usage periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ChatGPT_API rate limits are exceeded, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN ChatGPT_API returns an error, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL log the error details and display user-friendly messages
3. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL track API usage to monitor costs and usage patterns
4. WHEN API requests timeout, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL retry the request up to 3 times before failing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the type and depth of investment analysis I receive, so that the reports match my specific investment goals and experience level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL provide options for different report types (basic, intermediate, advanced)
2. WHEN a user selects a report type, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL use appropriate prompts for ChatGPT_API
3. THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL allow users to specify focus areas (risk analysis, growth potential, market trends)
4. WHEN generating reports, THE Investment_Analysis_System SHALL include user preferences in the ChatGPT_API request
