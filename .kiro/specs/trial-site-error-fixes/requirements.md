# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical JavaScript errors and functionality issues affecting the trial site, including duplicate function declarations, authentication token refresh failures, and broken file upload capabilities that prevent users from properly interacting with the application.

## Glossary

- **Trial_Site**: The web application that provides investment analysis and report generation services
- **File_Upload_System**: The drag-and-drop and file selection functionality for document uploads
- **Frontend_Error_Handler**: The client-side error logging and handling system
- **JavaScript_Engine**: The browser's JavaScript execution environment that processes all client-side code

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without JavaScript errors, so that I can access all functionality without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trial_Site loads, THE Frontend_Error_Handler SHALL not log duplicate function declaration errors
2. THE Trial_Site SHALL ensure all JavaScript functions are declared only once per scope
3. IF duplicate function declarations are detected, THEN THE Trial_Site SHALL consolidate them into single declarations
4. THE Trial_Site SHALL validate all script loading sequences to prevent naming conflicts
5. WHEN the page renders completely, THE Trial_Site SHALL execute without syntax errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication-related code gracefully without errors, so that I can use the trial site without authentication interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Trial_Site SHALL remove or disable authentication-related code that causes errors
2. WHEN authentication code is present, THE Trial_Site SHALL handle missing authentication gracefully
3. THE Trial_Site SHALL not attempt to refresh tokens or make authentication requests
4. IF authentication errors occur, THEN THE Trial_Site SHALL suppress them without affecting functionality
5. THE Trial_Site SHALL operate in trial mode without requiring user authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files through drag-and-drop or file selection, so that I can provide documents for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags files over the upload area, THE File_Upload_System SHALL provide visual feedback
2. WHEN files are dropped, THE File_Upload_System SHALL process and upload them successfully
3. THE File_Upload_System SHALL support file selection through traditional file input methods
4. IF file upload fails, THEN THE File_Upload_System SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. THE File_Upload_System SHALL validate file types and sizes before processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_Error_Handler SHALL capture all JavaScript errors with context information
2. WHEN errors occur, THE Frontend_Error_Handler SHALL log them with timestamps and stack traces
3. THE Trial_Site SHALL provide error recovery mechanisms where possible
4. THE Frontend_Error_Handler SHALL categorize errors by severity and type
5. WHEN critical errors occur, THE Trial_Site SHALL gracefully degrade functionality rather than breaking completely
