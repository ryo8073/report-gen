# Prompt System Optimization - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the optimization of the PROMPTS directory files to ensure they are properly formatted for AI processing and seamlessly integrated into the report generation system. The current prompt files contain valuable content but need structural improvements for better AI comprehension and processing efficiency.

## Glossary

- **Prompt Template**: A structured instruction file that guides AI report generation
- **AI Processing**: The interpretation and execution of prompt instructions by AI models
- **Report Generation System**: The backend API that processes prompts and generates reports
- **Prompt Manager**: The system component that loads and manages prompt templates
- **Structured Format**: A standardized format that ensures consistent AI interpretation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the prompt files to be properly structured and formatted, so that AI models can process them efficiently and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads prompt files, THE System SHALL parse them without formatting errors
2. WHEN AI models process the prompts, THE System SHALL interpret instructions clearly and consistently
3. THE System SHALL maintain consistent formatting across all prompt files
4. WHEN prompts contain special characters or formatting, THE System SHALL handle them correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the prompt files to follow a standardized structure, so that they can be easily maintained and updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL use consistent section headers across all prompt files
2. THE System SHALL follow a standardized template structure for all report types
3. WHEN new prompt files are added, THE System SHALL follow the established format conventions
4. THE System SHALL include proper metadata and documentation in each prompt file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI service, I want the prompts to contain clear and unambiguous instructions, so that I can generate high-quality reports consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide clear role definitions for the AI in each prompt
2. THE System SHALL include specific formatting requirements for report output
3. THE System SHALL specify data extraction and analysis requirements clearly
4. WHEN processing files, THE System SHALL provide clear instructions for handling different file types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the report generation to work reliably with optimized prompts, so that I receive consistent and high-quality reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports, THE System SHALL use optimized prompts that produce consistent results
2. THE System SHALL handle Japanese language content correctly in all prompts
3. THE System SHALL maintain report quality across different AI services (OpenAI and Gemini)
4. WHEN switching between AI services, THE System SHALL adapt prompts appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the prompt loading system to be robust and error-resistant, so that the application remains stable even with prompt file issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompt files have formatting issues, THE System SHALL provide clear error messages
2. THE System SHALL fall back to default prompts when file loading fails
3. THE System SHALL validate prompt file integrity during loading
4. WHEN prompt files are updated, THE System SHALL reload them without requiring restart
